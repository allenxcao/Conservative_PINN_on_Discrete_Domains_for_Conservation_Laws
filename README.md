In the paper (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045782520302127), the authors introduce an innovative approach called the conservative physics-informed neural network (cPINN) to tackle nonlinear conservation laws on discrete domains. This method involves dividing the computational domain into discrete sub-domains and ensuring flux continuity in the strong form at the interfaces between these sub-domains. To achieve this, separate neural networks are employed to enforce an average solution at the common interface between two sub-domains.

In this presentation, we will demonstrate the implementation of cPINN for the Burgers equation and compare its accuracy with the results obtained using the standard Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach. The code for this implementation is written in Pytorch.

With this presentation, we aim to showcase the effectiveness and advantages of cPINN in solving the Burgers equation, a common nonlinear conservation law problem. By comparing the results with the traditional PINN method, we can gain insights into the improvements achieved by using cPINN in such applications. The use of Pytorch facilitates a flexible and efficient implementation of the method, enabling us to explore its potential for various real-world scenarios.
